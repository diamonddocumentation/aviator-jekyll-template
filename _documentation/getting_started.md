  Welcome to the ZAP API.


  ZAP provides a REST Application Programming Interface (API) which allows you
  to interact with ZAP programmatically.


  The REST API can be accessed directly or via one of the client implementations
  detailed below.


  It is documented briefly in the ZAP [user
  guide](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki/HelpStartConceptsApi)


  View all functionality generated by the code by viewing the API functions on
  the left.<br>&nbsp;
  
  The API URLs are of the form:

http://zap/<format>/<component>/<operation>/<operation name>[/?<parameters>]

The format can currently be 'JSON', 'XML' or 'HTML' - choose whichever you can consume more easily

The operation can be 'view' or 'action'

The components, operation names and parameters can all be discovered by browsing the API.

So you should now be able to use the API directly based on the information you can get from the API UI.

Remember it is only accessible when you are proxying via ZAP.
