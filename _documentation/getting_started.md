  Welcome to the ZAP API.


  ZAP provides a REST Application Programming Interface (API) which allows you
  to interact with ZAP programmatically.


  The REST API can be accessed directly or via one of the client implementations
  detailed below.


  It is documented briefly in the ZAP [user
  guide](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki/HelpStartConceptsApi)
